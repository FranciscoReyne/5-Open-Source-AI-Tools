TensorFlow - PyTorch - OpenAI Gym - Stable Diffusion - Hugging Face Transformers


## 1. TensorFlow
TensorFlow, developed by Google, is one of the most popular open-source machine learning frameworks. It supports deep learning, neural networks, and various AI models
Works on everything from a smartphone to a large-scale distributed system. Offers TensorFlow Hub (Pre-trained Models), where you can access ready-to-use AI models. 

    pip install tensorflow


## 2. PyTorch

PyTorch, created by Facebook, Unlike TensorFlow’s static graphs, PyTorch lets you modify computations on the go (Dynamic Computation Graphs). GPU CUDA for high-speed training.

    pip install torch torchvision



## 3. OpenAI Gym

 OpenAI Gym provides an extensive collection of environments for developing and testing RL algorithms. recommended for reinforcement learning (RL) tasks.

    pip install gym



## 4. Stable Diffusion

Create unique visuals based on textual descriptions, Text-to-image AI models. Adjust image styles, resolution, and details.

    git clone https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion

## 5. Hugging Face Transformers


Use NLP models with just a few lines of code. For text-based AI tasks Hugging Face’s Transformers library is a must. Access models for text generation, sentiment analysis, translation, and more. 

    pip install transformers
